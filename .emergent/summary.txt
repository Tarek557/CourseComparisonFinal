The AI engineer iteratively developed a UK university course comparison website. Initial efforts focused on UI, basic comparison, and data expansion from 12 to 130+ universities. Key challenges included adapting to course-level comparisons and replicating DiscoverUni-style UI for listings. A critical bug fix for state management in  was also addressed. The project pivoted from a proposed database implementation back to a manual embedded data approach, aiming for 50 universities initially. A significant UI improvement involved implementing main search results pagination, removing per-university pagination. The current work involves a massive expansion of Bachelor degree courses (BSc, BA, BEng) across 50 universities, with 12 now comprehensively expanded. This demonstrates agile, user-driven development, prioritizing immediate feature delivery and data completeness within existing architecture.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a UK university course comparison website. Initial requirements included listing 130+ UK universities and specific course types (Computer Science), with side-by-side comparison for selected institutions based on various criteria and rankings. This evolved to comprehensive course data for *all* 130+ universities, dynamic program type selection, and integrating student reviews. A key UI/UX requirement was mimicking DiscoverUni's course listing style, including displaying course counts and individual course listings. The core functionality shifted from university-level to granular course-level comparison, demanding authentic, detailed course data. Latest refinements included: exclusively focusing on BSc courses for an initial 50 universities (rejecting a database migration for a manual embedded approach), removing introductory text under the Search Courses tab to only show data upon user input, and a massive expansion to include 20-30 Bachelor degrees (BSc, BA, BEng) per university across all major disciplines. A recent request involved implementing pagination for long search result lists.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React.js**: Frontend UI development.
-   **FastAPI**: Python backend for API services (minimal use in current MVP, data embedded frontend).
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database (configured, but not utilized for main data due to user choice).
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for styling.
-   **Environment Variables**: ,  for configuration.
-   **Kubernetes Ingress**:  prefix for backend routing.
-   **Supervisor**: Process control for managing services.

-   :
    -   **Summary of importance**: The core React component managing the entire application's UI, state, data rendering, search logic, and comparison. It holds the university and course data directly embedded within its structure for this MVP.
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        -   Initially displayed 12, then 37, then 130+ universities, with dynamic program selection and student reviews.
        -   Refactored for DiscoverUni-style course counts and individual professional course listings, shifting to course-level comparison.
        -   Implemented logic for individual course selection and the  component.
        -   Fixed a critical runtime error related to  being undefined by adding safeguards.
        -   Modified to prevent the university grid from showing when the Search Courses tab is active without a search term (showing an empty state instead).
        -   Underwent massive data additions for BSc courses, then later for BA and BEng courses for 50 universities, embedding this data directly into the file.
        -   Introduced pagination logic for the *main search results* (displaying 6 universities per page), removing previously added per-university pagination. This involved adding ,  states,  function, and modifying rendering logic in  to slice  based on current page and display pagination controls. It also ensures the page resets when the search term changes.

-   :
    -   **Summary of importance**: Custom CSS styling for the React application, leveraging Tailwind for responsive and visually appealing UI.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Evolved to support new UI elements like student reviews and specific DiscoverUni-style elements. Updated to support the new pagination UI, including styling for page numbers and navigation buttons.

-   :
    -   **Summary of importance**: FastAPI backend for API endpoints. Though a database was discussed, the user opted to continue with embedded frontend data.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Initially rewritten as part of a bulk file write. No explicit changes were detailed in the provided trajectory *after* the initial setup. Backend stability was confirmed by  after frontend data expansion.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Continue Comprehensive Course Expansion**: Expand the remaining 38 universities (out of the target 50) with 20-30 Bachelor degrees (BSc, BA, BEng) each, covering all major academic disciplines.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively expanding the course data for UK universities. Following a user decision to stick with the manual embedded data approach, the current goal is to have 50 universities with comprehensive Bachelor degree course data (BSc, BA, BEng). So far, 12 universities have been fully expanded to include 20-30 diverse courses each, covering Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Sciences, Psychology, Arts & Humanities, Social Sciences, Business, and more.

Recently, a significant UI/UX improvement was implemented: pagination for the main course search results. Previously, searching for a course like computing would list all matching universities (e.g., 30+) requiring extensive scrolling. Now, the search results are paginated, displaying 6 universities per page with navigation controls (Previous, page numbers, Next). This enhances user experience by making long result lists manageable. The system automatically resets to page 1 when a new search term is entered. The internal per-university course pagination was removed to align with the user's clarified request for main search results pagination only. The backend was recently tested and confirmed to be working perfectly despite these extensive frontend data and UI modifications.
